# M-emory Alloc-ation (malloc)

- This is memory allocation not the other way, ie int a [5];
- That denoted an array of 5 integers. Very fixed.
- That's where malloc comes in. What is we needed more?
- int * *arr* can be : malloc(sizeof(int) x 5));
- yea , here we have allocated our int arr the size of five integers (take into consideration of the size of each int then five of those)
